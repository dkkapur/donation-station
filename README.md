# DonationStation
### Empowering people and charitable organizations to do more good by connecting donors and volunteers with the right opportunities. 
*MS Hackathon 18*

## Description

DonationStation is a hub for people looking to help NGOs and charitable organizations - it connects them with organizations with a need for their volunteer work and donations.

## Inspiration

Katri has an old but clean, barely used mattress. He’s been looking for a place to donate it but can only think of the Salvation Army. They do schedule pick-ups, but only when he is at work. He’s been looking for another way to get it into the hands of someone who actually needs it.

A lot of us have been in situations where we’ve been looking for the right place to donate things. Whether it is an older pair of jeans, or blankets no longer needed - we tend to only think about Goodwill, the Salvation Army, and a handful of other charitable organizations, and try to find the easiest way for us to get them the items. This isn’t always the most optimal approach. While these are noble organizations, by not considering other options we miss out on organizations that may have needed the items more, or that had more convenient pickup options! These might be smaller or less well known.

DonationStation was born out of the idea that there is a fundamental information mismatch between people who are looking to donate and the charities who are looking to receive donations. Not all charities offer the options needed by a donor, and not all donors offer what a specific charity needs. . Too often, good intentions are met with missed opportunities. DonationStation aims to share opportunities directly catered to the people who want to volunteer their goods or time.  We’re hoping that DonationStation enables you to be able to contribute more and better to the world around you.

Katri has an old but clean, barely used mattress. He’s still looking for a place to send it to, but he’s now registered as a donor on DonationStation. Now Katri will be notified when an  NGO or charitable organization out there is looking for mattresses. He might be matched with a drop off even for home materials following a devastating hurricane, a meeting in a nearby parking lot, or maybe a neighbourhood garage sale for charitable causes.

## How it works

DonationStation consists of two main interaction scenarios depending on the user: whether you are looking to donate items or your time, or are a charitable organization. (Future) donors and volunteers will interact with DonationStation through our mobile application, with a one time registration and the ability to change causes they would be interested in supporting and specific items they’d like to donate.

As an NGO or a charitable organization, you interact with DonationStation through our web application, where upon registering, you can create new donation events. These events are location-specific, and can be pick-ups or drop-offs for certain items. You also have the option of setting up volunteering opportunities as an event to help garner a larger audience and find people in the area who are interested in helping out with your specific causes. When your event is created, we’ll automatically notify potential donors in the area about it, matching you with them based on their locations, the items and talents they have, and if they are interested in causes that align with yours.

In the future, we plan on building features that will help solve problems in the item donation space, including quality control of items being donated, automated hooks to systems which will match your donations (ex. MS Give), and giving organizations data to host events only when there is  enough “supply” of items or people willing to volunteer for a particular cause in a specific place. Organizations can then upload data from events and use intelligent data analytics to optimize their required resources, freeing up the manpower and providing the resources to empower the organization to do more good.
